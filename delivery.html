            <h2>How it works ?</h2>
            <p>You will receive a tracking number and will be kept up to date with dispatch, transit and delivery of your parcel via email or text. Our courier service will aim to deliver your goods between the times of 11.00 Am – 6.00 Pm.</p>
            <p>It is important that you ensure somebody is present at the delivery address to collect your order, or alternatively, please make sure you fill in the ‘Delivery Instructions’ and provide the driver with as many details as possible – for instance you may request to have your box delivered to a neighbour’s house or put in a safe place (shed or porch). The courier will always look for a safe location to leave your parcel should you not leave any delivery instructions and there is nobody home to collect the goods.</p>
            <p>Should the courier fail to deliver the box it will be taken back to the  nearest depot and we will contact you with regards to re-arranging delivery. unfortunately  our courier service cannot re-attempt delivery on the same day hence your parcel will be delivered the next working day between 11 am and 6 pm.</p>
            <p>The Company’s boxes are specially designed to keep your meats chilled and fresh for up to 48 hours so do not worry in the event your order takes an extra day!</p>

            <p>Plastic Tray Packaging - Our meat and fish products are sealed in trays after they have been freshly cut to ensure they stay as fresh as the moment they were prepared.</p>
            <p>Additional Packaging – we will use additional bubble wrap and/or Styrofoam to protect against any breakages of glass or our ambient products.</p>
            <p>Temprature -The box will maintain the temprature at 5-8 degrees as a legal requirement from FSA (Food Standards Agency) </p>
            <p>And don’t forget…..</p>
